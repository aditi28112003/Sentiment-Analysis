#Sentiment Analysis using Python#

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using Python. It utilizes the string library for text preprocessing and the Counter class from the collections module for analysis. Additionally, it employs matplotlib for visualization.
Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

bash

pip install matplotlib

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd sentiment-analysis

    Run the Python script sentiment_analysis.py:

bash

python sentiment_analysis.py

Dependencies

    string: For text preprocessing including removing punctuation.
    collections: For counting occurrences of words.
    matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting graphs.

Approach

    Data Preprocessing: The text data is preprocessed to remove punctuation, convert text to lowercase, and tokenize the words.

    Sentiment Analysis: The frequency of words is counted, and sentiment analysis is performed based on predefined positive and negative words.

    Visualization: The results of sentiment analysis are visualized using matplotlib, showing the distribution of positive and negative words.
